function

math function for adding up calculateRoundScore 

if dice1 = 0 OR dice2 = 0
    then Score = 0
else if dice1 == dice2
    then Score = (dice1.value+dice2.value)*2
else (
    Score = dice1.value+dice2.value
)

return Score


math function for adding totalGameScore = totalGameScore + currentRoundScore


function to determineWinner

If player1 totalGameScore > player2 totalGameScore
    return "You won!"
else player1 totalGameScore < player2 totalGameScore
    return "Too bad! Try again."
else   
    return "It's a tie!"

math rules

calulating history

Create a dice game where a user plays against the computer. The user and the computer each
roll a pair of dice 3 times. After the third roll of the dice the player with highest score wins
The scoring for the game works as follows:

- If any of the players two dice comes up as a 1 then the score for that round for the
player is 0. eg: if the player rolls a 6 and 1, they get a score of 0
- If the player rolls a pair of the same numbers then the players score is the total of the
two dice times 2. eg: if he player rolls 5 and 5, they get a score of (5+5)*2=20
- If the player rolls any other combination of dice other than the ones mentioned above
then the players score is the total value of the two dice, eg: player rolls a 3 and 2,
player gets a score of 3+2=5
-


The game should provide a text or graphical output showing the following:
- The current rolled dice by the player and the computer
- The score for this round for the player and the computer
- The total score for the game


The game should provide a button that will roll the dice for the player and the computer
After three rolls of the dice the game should total up the scores and display a message
displaying who the winner was

The game should provide a button that will reset the game and start a new game
